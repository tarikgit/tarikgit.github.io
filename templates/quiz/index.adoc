= My First Quiz

== Include external html file : quiz1.html

This is difficult to edit. Searching for Markdown or asciidoctor equivalent.

include::quiz1.html[]

== Include external html file : quiz2.html

Here I used a link:https://www.htmlcodegenerator-tools.com/2019/10/html-javascript-quiz-generator-score-timer.html[quiz generator]. This is still very cumbersome since I have to edit the quiz on a webpage and I cannot edit or reuse existing quizzes.

== Include external html file : quiz3.html

link:https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_select.asp[Source]

Useless for my needs.
