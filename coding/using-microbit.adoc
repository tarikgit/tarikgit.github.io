= Using BBC micro:bit

The following page is an overview of teaching Python using the BBC micro:bit.
The documentation can be found at the link:https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/v2-docs/[MicroPython documentation]
page.

== Hello World !

[source,micropython]
----
# Write your first Hello World
# with a scrolling heart
from microbit import *


while True:
    display.scroll('Hello, World!')
    display.show(Image.HEART)
    sleep(2000)
----

== Compass

The micro:bit has a built-in compass. The following code lets you use the
device as a compass. Before showing the magnetic north, the device will ask
you to calibrate it by moving it around.

[source,micropython]
----
from microbit import *


# Start calibrating
compass.calibrate()

# Try to keep the needle pointed in (roughly) the correct direction
while True:
    sleep(100)
    needle = ((15 - compass.heading()) // 30) % 12
    display.show(Image.ALL_CLOCKS[needle])
----

== Speech

Amazing! Your micro:bit can even talk ....

[source,micropython]
----
# Your micro:bit can even talk!
# Here it says "Hello World!""
import speech
import random
from microbit import sleep



# A sentence of your choice ...
sentence = "hello world!"

speech.say(sentence, speed=120, pitch=250, throat=200, mouth=200)
----
