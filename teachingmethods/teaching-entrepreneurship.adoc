= Technology Entrepreneurship Education

_Keywords:_ educational robotics, entrepreneurship, innovation, Arduino workshop, Raspberry Pi Pico, cross-disciplinary

*Technology entrepreneurship* is the interface between the more established academic fields of entrepreneurship and technology based innovation.



== Objectives for the learners

- develop effective problem-solving skills
- decompose problems into smaller parts
- use pseudocode as a tool for sequencing actions
- use existing code with attributes to recognise patterns
- systematically identify and fix bugs
- use conditions and compound conditions to program encoded devices

== Key Objectives

- use decomposition skills to break a complex problem down into smaller parts
- identify and fix programming problems
- develop their ability to recognise patterns and create effective programs
- explore conditional programming
- be able to explain the principle of digital security
- use computational thinking skills to produce a complete solutions to a problem
- create and follow a set of step-by-step pseudocode instructions
- decompose, identify, and fix problems in the pseudo code
