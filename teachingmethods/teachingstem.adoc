= Is the _Productivity Puzzle_ linked to Maths Teaching in the _Secondary Education System_?

A couple of years ago, economists brought to our attention the
link:https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/labourproductivity/articles/whatistheproductivitypuzzle/2015-07-07[productivity puzzle] in the UK.
The productivity that has been trending upwards since the 90s started first to
fall during the 2008-09 financial crisis and since 2010 to follow a flat growth
path. A similar pattern can be observed in Luxembourg. In this work, I discuss
the possible role that mathematics in secondary school curriculum can play for
tackling this issue.

As illustrated below, the slowing growth in productivity, even a stagnation,
is also present for Luxembourg. There has
been a steady growth between 1970 to 2008. Following the financial crisis,
productivity stopped growing. A drop in productivity following a crisis is
not uncommon and documented in the economics literature (see link:https://casee.asu.edu/upload/Prescott/2012-McGrattan-GPDER-The%20Great%20Recession%20and%20Delayed%20Economic%20Recovery%20A%20Labor%20Productivity%20Puzzle.pdf[McGrattan and Prescott, 2012]).
What _is_ uncommon is the length of the stagnation, which has last now for ten years.

One major difference between Luxembourg and the UK is related to
unemployment. Following a sharp
increase in unemployment in the UK after the 2008-09 crisis, unemployment has
been steadily decreasing until the recent covid19 crisis. For many this was
the main factor for the fall in productivity in the UK. This would also make
sense since the way productivity is calculated is to divide GDP by the number
of workers or the hours worked. If you reduce the number of workers, respectively
the hours worked, productivity will start to increase. There is a mechanism in
our economies that regulates this. As unemployment falls, wages should start
to increase since labor is becoming scarce. However this could not be observed
in the UK economy, pushing the unemployment to lower levels.

If we look at the case for Luxembourg, we cannot see the same pattern.
While productivity is falling similar to the UK, unemployment in Luxembourg
has shown an increasing trend since the 2008-09 crisis
(see link:https://data.oecd.org/chart/6let[figure]).

This change in the productivity pattern may not only have serious consequences
on the economy, but also on the society. If we focus our attention on the
pension system, we can see that the number of workers per social security
retiree has been falling over past decades. This trend can only be sustainable
if the productivity of the workers increases steadily over time.
If, in 2020, there are four workers supporting the pension of a retired worker,
we expect that in 2050 there will only be two workers supporting the pension
of future retired workers. This trend is not shocking and can be observed in
many Western countries. This would also be sustainable if the two workers in
the future were more productive than today's four workers. If we look at the
data in the table above and compare the level of productivity in 2010 with the
one in 1980, we can observe an approximate 80% growth. The social consequence
of this could be lower pensions in the future making the elder population even
more vulnerable due to rising caring home costs.
The following
table gives the _old-age to working-age demographic ratio_, which is defined as
the number of individuals aged 65 and over per 100 people of working age
defined as those at ages 20 to 64.

The economic costs would be multiple. A country with lower productivity means
it will be less attractive for foreign investments and companies. As a country
attracts less capital, it will be more difficult to renew existing productive
capital. This is the reason why recent governments have focused on innovation
and R&D. In the current context, this seems to be the only way to attract
investments and increase our productivity. Massive investments into a
university, research labs, space-mining, supercomputers (like the Meluxina project) are
essential. But we have also to think about the future workforce that will
be active in those fields, which brings us to the education system.

In the Luxembourg education system the impact of socio-economic background
on mathematics performance is above the OECD average (Source: link:https://www.oecd.org/luxembourg/Education-Policy-Outlook-Country-Profile-Luxembourg.pdf[OECD]).
As a consequence learners coming from a difficult socio-economic background may
consistently perform less well in tests and in the education system, in general.
However good level of
Mathematics is required in many subjects such as Physics, Economics, Biology.
Students with an insufficient level of Mathematics will be pushed into
sections or streams that have no or very light Mathematics in the curriculum.
Those who are lucky to make it into sections/streams that requires Maths
will systematically under-perform.

[short presentation of the Luxembourg school system, use a simplified graphics from mengschoul.lu]

And low-performing students can hamper productivity.
Therefore one strategy would be for schools to adress maths and science literacy
for the large numbers of low-performing students
(link:https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1038/453028a[Nature 453, pages 28–30(2008)]).
This would have to start before the learners are streamed, which happens at 4eme.
Therefore the key years during which learners have to stimulated in the field of
mathematics would be 7ieme, 6ieme and 5ieme.

Maths and technology education is not only required in today's society but
it plays a crucial role.
In many cases, technical knowledge is a prerequisite for participating in
public debate. Then there is all the technology in everyday life that needs to
be operated. Financial education, which helps youngsters to make the right
consumption, saving and investment decisions requires also basic maths knowledge.

In the UK, it has been shown that the main sectors responsible for the fall
in productivity are finance, utilities, pharmaceuticals, computing and
professional services. Most of these industries rely on innovation and staff
who can be technically challenged by a fast changing environment. A similar study
must be undertaken for Luxembourg. We must identify which sectors are concerned
and rapidly adapt our education system to fix these issues.


== Concluding Remarks

One assumption of the falling productivity growth is that the education system
in the UK has changed throughout the past decades. Vocational training was
devalorized against university studies.

Another assumption is a reform that made it easier for students to
skip Maths for their A-level. Lack of mathematical skills could be the
source of the loss in productivity. Especially since future jobs will
rely on coding and solving complex problems, that can only be solved using
mathematical tools (e.g. coding is today present in linguistics, paleonthology,
biology, ... fields that used to be exempt of coding and maths).

We have to start early on (e.g. 7ieme, 6ieme) not only to win youngsters into
fascinating field of applied mathematics but also to actively design strategies
to avoid losing them.

For this we must make use of all the tools designed in STEM teaching. Coding
robots has to be part of the curriculum in Maths. Students must be introduced
to mathematical concepts together with applied maths in robotics/Python.

Improving outcomes, says Peter McLaren, executive director of the non-profit initiative Next Gen Education, will require a shift in the classroom from a teacher-centred approach to one that helps students work through concepts themselves.

However, some of the concepts might not translate easily. Some systems are built around strict standards or large class sizes that would make it difficult for teachers to give students the focused, personalized guidance they need.

One realization was that trying to explain concepts and then have students apply them — or worse, simply regurgitate them — did not work. Instead, teachers should create projects in which concepts become apparent as students work through real-world challenges.

One explanation for the combination of dismal productivity figures and
exciting innovation is delay: *it takes a long time for new technologies
to be turned into widely used commercial applications*. The *more fundamental
the innovation, the longer the lag* is likely to be.
This was true for electricity, for computers in the early days, and
will be true for newer technologies such as AI. Other potential factors
include demographic change, the hangover from the financial crisis and
misallocation of capital.
[quote]
Another explanation favoured by some economists — and by the tech
community — is that output, and therefore productivity, are being
mis-measured. The Stanford/MIT paper defines an “idea” as a unit of national
output (as currently measured) divided by the total number of researcher hours.

The answer, in part, is because of the way economic output, as gross domestic
product, is defined.

For one thing, it excludes unpaid work in the home. Hence the steady
transition of women into paid work during the second half of the 20th
century flattered that era’s growth and productivity figures. For another,
the investment figures included in GDP have omitted intangible investments,
including in ideas. Statistics agencies are only just starting to incorporate
these, so all of those researchers have been generating some uncounted output.

The UK’s *labour productivity underperformance* is at least partly the
*flipside of the rise in employment*. Yet the *continued failure of wage
growth to rise* as the BoE has expected suggests that the central bank could
run the economy quite a lot hotter until it begins to run out of workers.
Along the way, productivity is likely to rise, as it tends to do in booms,
when companies start to look for efficiency improvements.

Certains désignent déjà les jeunes entrant sur le marché du travail de ces
pays touchés par la récession comme une « génération perdue ». Le postulat
est simple et étayé par de nombreuses études : « Lors d’une récession, la
cohorte de jeunes entrant sur le marché du travail a plus de difficultés à
s’insérer que la cohorte précédente. »
[quote]
Les effets négatifs d’une récession s’illustrent également par d’autres
aspects de la vie sociale : le nombre d’enfants, le taux de divorce, la
santé déclarée ou la mortalité sont autant de facteurs affectés de manière
négative par une entrée sur le marché du travail en période de récession.
Avec un impact immédiat sur la productivité de la cohorte concernée.

Le CNP considère le *ralentissement de la productivité du capital humain*
comme la principale source du ralentissement de la productivité globale en
France : « Entre 1976 et 1986, il *contribuait pour 2,2 points à la forte
croissance de la productivité*, de 3,4 % en moyenne annuelle », alors que
« *depuis 2004, sa contribution n’est plus que de 0,6 point* annuellement »
pour une croissance totale de la productivité de 0,7 %.

 L’inadéquation des compétences (utilisation sous-optimale des compétences

 Low productivity is possibly the most important challenge that the UK
 economy faces because it affects the living standards we can sustain.
 Against this background, the disappointing productivity record of many UK
 businesses has provoked significant concern amongst policy, academic and
 business communities. The factors contributing to this picture remain the
 subject of debate. Much can be learned from careful investigation of
 firm-level micro data.

 If we want to get richer, we must be more productive, so there’s a
 “productivity crisis”. Never mind that unemployment is at a 42-year low,
 we are miserably unproductive compared with other countries, and thus
 doomed to stagnant standards of living. These figures imply that, instead
 of getting more efficient, we are simply employing more people.
 But what if we are measuring the wrong things? It’s simple to count cars
 from a factory (although less simple to capture model improvements) but in
 a service economy like Britain’s, measuring output is hard. Is a longer
 newspaper article more productive than a shorter one? What about making
 phone calls on the train? Search? Emails? Same day delivery? All short-circuit
 problems which took hours or even days to solve in the pre-internet era.

 Low business investment, poor management skills, difficulties in measuring
 the new digital economy and loose monetary policy prolonging the survival
 of “zombie” companies all help to account for the UK’s “productivity puzzle”.
 One other explanation that has heavily influenced policy — highlighted last
 year by Andy Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist — is the fact
 that the UK has an unusually long tail of productivity laggards that pull
 down the national average.

 The Treasury has also earmarked £20m for a pilot led by Jürgen Maier,

There is evidence that employment training can be effective in tackling this
issue by not only bringing people back into work but by also helping them
acquire new skills and move up on the earnings ladder. In around half of the
evaluations on this topic reviewed by the What Works Centre (WWC), employment
training had a positive impact on wages and employment.
[quote]
But in terms of outcomes, the way the training is designed matters. Looking at
the duration of trainings, the review found that short programmes are more
effective for less formal training activity while longer programmes generate
gains when the content is skill-intensive but the benefits take longer to
materialize.
[quote]
When it comes to the format of the training, on-the-job training programmes
tend to outperform classroom-based ones. This is because employers engage
directly with the course and the participants tend to acquire skills that
match more closely what employers need. This could also be due to the fact
that the participants have already established a relationship with their
potential employer.
