"Cheapness is the
    sentence of death to the producer on a small scale who has no
    money to invest in the purchase of machinery that his rich
    rivals can easily procure. Cheapness is the great instrument in
    the hands of monopoly; it absorbs the small manufacturer, the
    small shopkeeper, the small proprietor; it is, in one word, the
    destruction of the middle classes for the advantage of a few
    industrial oligarchs."
-- John Stuart Mill, link:http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38138[Socialism]


"Competition is the best security for cheapness, but by no
means a security for quality. In former times, when producers and
consumers were less numerous, it was a security for both. The market
was not large enough nor the means of publicity sufficient to enable a
dealer to make a fortune by continually attracting new customers: his
success depended on his retaining those that he had; and when a dealer
furnished good articles, or when he did not, the fact was soon known
to those whom it concerned, and he acquired a character for honest or
dishonest dealing of more importance to him than the gain that would
be made by cheating casual purchasers."
