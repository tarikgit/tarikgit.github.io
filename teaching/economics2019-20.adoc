== Chapter 1: Basic economic ideas and resource allocation

=== Outline

At the outset of the course, it is essential that learners develop their understanding of the basic economic problem of scarcity and choice, and why this arises. This section also introduces the key fundamental economic ideas and principles which will underpin learning throughout the rest of the course. In particular, basic economic concepts and their links to the key concept Scarcity and choice are examined in detail.

The AS Level (2iec) topics covered in this section are:

* scarcity, choice and opportunity cost
* positive and normative statements
* factors of production
* resource allocation in different economic systems and issues of transition
* production possibility curves
* money
* classification of goods and services.

== Chapter 2: The price system and the micro economy

=== Outline

The theory of supply and demand and how it is used to determine market equilibrium levels of price and output are fundamental requirements for understanding and applying economic knowledge throughout the curriculum and in real-life practice. This section provides a basic platform from which learners are able to analyse and evaluate a variety of alternative market situations.

The AS Level (2iec) topics covered in this section are:

* demand and supply curves
* price elasticity, income elasticity and cross-elasticities of demand
* price elasticity of supply
* interaction of demand and supply
* market equilibrium and disequilibrium
* consumer and producer surplus.

== Chapter 4: The macroeconomy

This section introduces learners to the study of the economy as a whole, rather than focusing upon the behaviour of particular markets. It develops knowledge and understanding of key macroeconomic indicators such as inflation, balance of payments and exchange rates and enables learners to apply this understanding to analyse and evaluate aggregate economic behaviour in a range of different economic settings.

=== Outline

The AS Level topics covered in this section are:

* aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS) analysis
* inflation
* balance of payments
* exchange rates
* the terms of trade
* principles of absolute and comparative advantage
* protectionism.

== Chapter 5: Government macro intervention

This section builds on the learning undertaken in the previous AS units to link together macroeconomic theory and government macroeconomic policy. In particular, learners will have the opportunity to focus on the key fiscal, monetary and supply side policy instruments and look at how effective these are in correcting balance of payment deficits, inflation and deflation. Learners will also have plenty of opportunity to look at different approaches and assess and evaluate how effective governments are in achieving their macro-economic aims.

The AS Level topics covered in this section are:

* types of policy: fiscal, monetary and supply side policy
* policies to correct balance of payments disequilibrium
* policies to correct inflation and deflation.
